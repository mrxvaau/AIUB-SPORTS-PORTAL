## 🔥 Recent Updates Log

> ⚡ **Chain Reaction Rule**: Always READ this section → Work → UPDATE this section → READ again

### 2026-02-08 12:47 - Implemented: Team Mutual Exclusivity System
- **What**: Added duplicate prevention + auto-removal for team memberships per game
- **Where**: `teamController.js` (backend), `registration.html` + `dashboard.html` (frontend)
- **Features**:
  1. **Duplicate Prevention**: Leaders can't add users already CONFIRMED on another team for same game
  2. **Auto-Removal**: Users accepting one team are auto-removed from all other PENDING teams for that game
- **Impact**: Prevents confusion, ensures one user = one team per game
- **Files Modified**: `teamController.js`, `registration.html`, `dashboard.html`

### 2026-02-08 12:23 - Fixed: Profile Setup Page CSS Not Loading
- **What**: Fixed critical CSS bug causing profile-setup.html to display unst yled
- **Root Cause**: `</style>` tag closed on line 43, but CSS continued outside (lines 49-277)
- **Solution**: Moved closing style tag to after all CSS rules (line 277)
- **Impact**: Profile setup page now displays correctly with proper styling
- **Files Modified**: `profile-setup.html`

### 2026-02-08 11:44 - Created: PROJECT_MEMORY.md System
- **What**: Initialized comprehensive memory file with full project documentation
- **Where**: Root directory `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` + workflow `.agent/workflows/memory-update.md`
- **Why**: Enable session continuity across account switches and agent transitions
- **Impact**: Any agent can now get full context instantly
- **Files**: PROJECT_MEMORY.md (17KB), memory-update.md workflow

### 2026-02-08 11:39 - Documented: Recent Bug Fixes
- **What**: Documented 5 major bug fixes from previous sessions
- **Where**: "Known Issues & Fixes" section below
- **Bugs Fixed**: Cancel button disappearing, cart integration, team validation, modal state, game ID stability
- **Impact**: Future agents won't re-investigate already-fixed issues

## 🔑 Key Features & Business Logic

### 1. Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Login with Microsoft"
2. Redirects to Azure AD OAuth
3. Only `@student.aiub.edu` and `@aiub.edu` emails allowed
4. Auto-creates user profile on first login
5. Redirects to profile setup if `is_first_login = true`
6. Validates student ID format: `XX-XXXXX-X`

### 2. Profile Management
- **First Login**: Must complete profile (name, gender, phone, blood group, program, department)
- **Name Edit Limit**: Users can edit name max 3 times (`name_edit_count`)
- **Locked Fields**: Gender, program, department CANNOT be changed after initial setup
- **Session Tracking**: `last_login` timestamp updated on each login

### 3. Tournament System
- **Admin Actions**: Create/edit/delete tournaments and games
- **Game Categories**: Male, Female, Mix
- **Game Types**:
  - **Solo**: Individual registration
  - **Duo**: 2-person teams
  - **Custom**: Variable team size (configured per game)
- **Registration Deadline**: Enforced server-side
- **Payment Status**: PENDING/PAID/FAILED tracking

### 4. Team Registration Flow
1. User opens game card for Duo/Custom game
2. Creates team with unique team name
3. System auto-adds user as LEADER
4. Leader adds team members by student ID
5. Invited members receive notifications
6. Members accept/reject team invitations
7. Cart holds registrations until checkout

**🆕 Team Mutual Exclusivity** (Added 2026-02-08):
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Leaders cannot add users who are already CONFIRMED on another team for the same game
  - Backend validates in `addTeamMember` function
  - Returns error: `"This user is already on a team for this game"`
  - Frontend shows error toast in `registration.html`
- **Auto-Removal**: When user accepts one team invitation:
  - System finds all OTHER pending team memberships for same game
  - Automatically deletes those memberships
  - Archives related notifications
  - Returns count of removed teams in success message
  - Frontend displays: `"Accepted! You were removed from X other pending team(s)."`

### 5. Cart System
- Holds both individual and team registrations
- UNIQUE constraint: one item per (user_id, tournament_game_id)
- Item types: `INDIVIDUAL_REGISTRATION`, `TEAM_REGISTRATION`
- Users can cancel registrations from cart

### 6. Notification System
- Types: INFO, WARNING, SUCCESS, TEAM_REQUEST
- Statuses: UNREAD, READ, ARCHIVED
- Related to teams, games, tournaments via `related_id` and `related_type`

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

### Recent Bug Fixes (from conversation history)

#### 1. ✅ FIXED: Cancel Registration Button Disappearing
**Problem**: After editing tournament details in admin panel, the "Cancel Registration" button would disappear for already-registered users.

**Root Cause**: Tournament edits caused game IDs to change, breaking the registration state tracking.

**Solution**: Implemented proper state management to preserve registrations across tournament updates.

**Files Modified**: 
- `frontend/registration.html`
- Admin dashboard game editing logic

---

#### 2. ✅ FIXED: Cart Integration Issues
**Problem**: Cart functionality wasn't properly integrated with registration/cancellation flow.

**Root Cause**: Separate development of cart and registration systems caused sync issues.

**Solution**: 
- Unified cart operations with registration state
- Ensured cart updates on register/cancel actions
- Added proper cart state validation

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/controllers/cartController.js`
- `frontend/registration.html`

---

#### 3. ✅ FIXED: Team Name Validation Missing
**Problem**: Team modal didn't validate team name in real-time.

**Root Cause**: Inline validation only implemented for student ID search, not team name.

**Solution**: 
- Added real-time team name uniqueness validation
- Disabled submit button until valid unique name entered
- Added visual feedback for invalid/duplicate names

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/registration.html` (team modal logic)

---

#### 4. ✅ FIXED: Modal State Persistence
**Problem**: After canceling team creation, modal would reopen with stale data.

**Root Cause**: Modal state not properly reset on cancel/close.

**Solution**:
- Reset all modal fields on cancel
- Clear team member slots
- Reset validation states
- Prevent stale data from showing

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/registration.html` (modal reset logic)

---

#### 5. ✅ FIXED: Game ID Stability on Tournament Edit
**Problem**: Editing tournament games caused existing game IDs to shift, breaking registrations.

**Root Cause**: Admin panel re-created games instead of updating them.

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper UPDATE logic for existing games
- Only DELETE removed games
- Only INSERT new games
- Preserve game IDs for unchanged games

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/routes/admin.js` (tournament update endpoint)

---

#### 6. ✅ FIXED: Profile Setup Page CSS Not Rendering
**Problem**: Profile setup page displayed completely unstyled - CSS shown as text on page.

**Root Cause**: `</style>` tag closed prematurely on line 43, but CSS rules continued outside the style block from lines 49-277.

**Solution**:
- Removed early closing `</style>` tag on line 43
- Moved closing tag to line 277 (after all CSS rules)
- Moved content-hiding script to proper location

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/profile-setup.html` (lines 35-277)

---

### Current Known Issues

#### ⚠️ Issue 1: Debug Logs Still Present
**Status**: Minor - Non-blocking  
**Description**: Console.log statements still present throughout codebase from debugging sessions.

**Impact**: Low - Only affects console output, no functional impact.

**TODO**: Clean up debug logs before production deployment.

**Files**: 
- Most frontend HTML files
- Some backend controllers

---

#### ⚠️ Issue 2: QWEN.md Outdated
**Status**: Documentation  
**Description**: `QWEN.md` still references Oracle database, but project migrated to Supabase.

**Impact**: None - Only confuses new developers.

**TODO**: Update or remove QWEN.md file.

---

#### ⚠️ Issue 3: RLS Policies Too Permissive
**Status**: Security - Important for Production  
**Description**: All Supabase RLS policies set to `FOR ALL USING (true)` (allow everything).

**Impact**: Development is fine, but MUST be restricted before production.

**TODO**: 
- Implement user-scoped RLS policies
- Admin-only policies for admin tables
- User can only see their own data

**Files**: `backend/supabase-schema.sql`

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned (Mistakes & Solutions)

> 📝 **Document mistakes here so future agents don't repeat them**

### Lesson 1: Always Preserve Game IDs on Tournament Edit
**Mistake**: Early implementation recreated all games when editing tournaments  
**Result**: Game IDs changed, breaking existing registrations  
**Solution**: Update existing games, only INSERT new ones, only DELETE removed ones  
**Prevention**: Check if game has an `id` field before deciding INSERT vs UPDATE  

### Lesson 2: Never Skip Modal State Reset
**Mistake**: Didn't clear modal fields on cancel/close  
**Result**: Reopening modal showed stale data from previous interaction  
**Solution**: Always reset all fields, validation states, and error messages on close  
**Prevention**: Create a dedicated `resetModal()` function called on every close event  

### Lesson 3: Cart Must Sync with Registration State
**Mistake**: Developed cart and registration systems separately  
**Result**: Cart could show outdated registration status  
**Solution**: Update cart immediately on register/cancel actions  
**Prevention**: Treat cart as source of truth, not just UI convenience  

### Lesson 4: Inline Validation Improves UX Significantly
**Mistake**: Only validated on form submit  
**Result**: Users didn't know if their input was valid until clicking submit  
**Solution**: Add real-time validation with visual feedback (✅/❌ icons)  
**Prevention**: Add inline validation for critical fields (emails, IDs, unique names)  

**💡 Add new lessons here as you discover them!**

## 📚 Important Code Patterns

### API Request Pattern (Frontend)
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/endpoint', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'x-user-email': sessionStorage.getItem('userEmail')
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ data })
});
```

### Supabase Query Pattern (Backend)
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('table_name')
    .select('*')
    .eq('column', value)
    .single();

if (error) throw error;
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
try {
    // Operation
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
}
```

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Email Validation**: STRICT enforcement of AIUB email domains
2. **Student ID Format**: Must match `XX-XXXXX-X` pattern
3. **JWT Tokens**: Used for session management
4. **Service Role Key**: NEVER expose to frontend (backend only)
5. **CORS**: Restricted to localhost during development
6. **File Uploads**: Limited to images, stored in `backend/uploads/`
7. **RLS Policies**: Must be tightened before production

---

## 🚨 Critical Warnings

### ⚠️ DO NOT
1. **DO NOT** commit `.env` file to git (it's gitignored)
2. **DO NOT** expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to frontend
3. **DO NOT** remove UNIQUE constraints on (user_id, game_id)
4. **DO NOT** change student ID format validation
5. **DO NOT** disable name edit limit enforcement
6. **DO NOT** deploy with permissive RLS policies

### ⚠️ ALWAYS
1. **ALWAYS** test registration flow after tournament edits
2. **ALWAYS** validate email domain server-side
3. **ALWAYS** check deadline before allowing registration
4. **ALWAYS** preserve game IDs when editing tournaments
5. **ALWAYS** reset modal state on close/cancel
6. **ALWAYS** validate team name uniqueness

---

## 💡 Tips for Future Agents

### When Starting a Session
1. **READ THIS FILE FIRST** - You're doing it right! 👍
2. Check `backend/.env` exists and has correct values
3. Verify both servers are running (backend:3000, frontend:3001)
4. Check Supabase project status (should be ACTIVE_HEALTHY)

### When Debugging
1. Check browser console for frontend errors
2. Check backend terminal for API errors
3. Verify network tab for failed requests
4. Check Supabase dashboard for database errors
5. Look at `admin-debug.html` for debug utilities

### When Making Changes
1. Test registration flow after ANY tournament/game changes
2. Verify cart state updates correctly
3. Check modal behavior (open/close/reset)
4. Test with different game types (Solo/Duo/Custom)
5. Verify deadline enforcement
6. Check notification generation

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Don't recreate games on tournament edit** - Update existing ones!
2. **Don't skip modal state reset** - Stale data causes bugs
3. **Don't forget cart sync** - Register/cancel should update cart
4. **Don't hardcode URLs** - Use `api-config.js`
5. **Don't trust IDs across sessions** - Game IDs must be stable
